# flippybit

flippybit is a terminal port of the browser game [flippy bit and the attack of the hexadecimals from base 16](https://flippybitandtheattackofthehexadecimalsfrombase16.com/). it plays nearly the same: hexadecimal robots fall down from the screen and you have to "flip" the binary bits (with number keys 1-8) to the correct hex string, destroying them before they hit the ground.

## installing
- run `make` to populate the ./build directory with binaries or `make run` just to launch

## dependencies
- linux (target os, works with some bugs on windows)
- golang
