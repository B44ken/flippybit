# flippybit

flippybit is a terminal port of the browser game flippy bit and the attack of the hexadecimals from base 16. it plays nearly the same: hexadecimal robots fall down from the screen and you have to "flip" the binary string (with number keys 1-8) to destroy them before they hit the ground.

running:
clone and use `run.sh` for linux (and maybe mac?) or `run.bat` for windows
