# flippybit

flippybit is a terminal port of the browser game [flippy bit and the attack of the hexadecimals from base 16](https://flippybitandtheattackofthehexadecimalsfrombase16.com/). it plays nearly the same: hexadecimal robots fall down from the screen and you have to "flip" the binary string (with number keys 1-8) to destroy them before they hit the ground.

installing:
- install golang (developed on 1.16) on linux (should support mac too)
- run `make` to populate the ./build directory with binaries or `make run` just to launch
